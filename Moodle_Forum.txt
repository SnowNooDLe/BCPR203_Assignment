1. Can a student be enrolled in many courses at one time ?
-> Students can be enrolled in more than one courses
-> 1< relationships
-> BUT THEY ONLY DO ONE COURSE AT A TIME (IMPORTANT)
-> Even though they enrolled ITTL300, ITTL310, ITTL320...
-> They do 300 first then 310 then 320... so on.
-> New record for each student should created for each course.
-> We only put into database when they are enrolled,

2. Student details - Names and ID ONLY
-> Attributes for student : Name and ID
-> Ara ID is a primary key
-> names varchar(25)

3. Branch needs to be considered and they need to be able to add more in future.

4. Booking, we only record if they are coming morning, afternoon or evening.

5. Notes- could be link to two things,
A. notes linked to the student to provide situational awareness for Staff
B. attached to a particular booking.
