Assumptions / Business Rules

1. Students should be attending a minimum of two sessions per week but they
can attend as often as they can
-> Stuents -> sessions 2 or more per week

2. Students cannot attend more than the allocated number of classes - unless
by arrangement with the Team Leader.
Provision needs to be made for Team Leaders to over-ride the maximum number of
allocated sessions.

3. Students need to complete their course within the allocated number of Weeks
-unless by arrangement with the Team Leaders
Same condition with 2, provision required.

4. Students can attend more than one branch
-> so its not 1 to 1 relationships.

5. Each class is two hours long and starts on the hour,

6. Students can attend more than one session on one day.
-> 0~many sessions on one day

7. Students do turn up early to classes.
Anyone attending 10 minutes before a class needs to be counted in the next class.
eg. 9:52am -> attending for 10am ~ 12pm lecture.

8. CFF students currently dont have Ara ID cards. In the ideal case they would be
able to use their ID card. In the short term, they may need to be provided with an
RFIT tag/card that does not have their student ID number as the code number of the
card
-> So we dont recognise student with their ID, we use card ID and allocate to students
